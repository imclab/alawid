<h1>7DRL</h1>

<p>This game is made for the <a href="http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=7DRL_Contest_2011">7 Day Roguelike Challenge 2011</a>.</p>

<p>The game is played inside a web browser and requires <a href="http://www.khronos.org/webgl/">WebGL</a> support, so you need a rather new browser (e.g. Google Chrome 10 or Firefox 4 - IE won't work). Also, your graphics card needs to be new enough (with good drivers) for WebGL to work.</p>
